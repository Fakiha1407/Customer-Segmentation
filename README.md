# Customer-Segmentation with KMeans Clustering

This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm. It uses synthetic customer data to group customers based on annual income and spending score.

# Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Feature Scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- KMeans clustering implementation
- Cluster visualization
- Saves clustered results to CSV

# Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

#  Dataset

Synthetic dataset generated within the notebook. No external data source used.

# How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fakiha1407/Customer-Segmentation.git
   cd Customer-Segmentation
